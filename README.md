This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in PHP: silent failure when dealing with unexpected data types in array input. The `calculateSum` function is designed to sum up numbers in an array, but it does not explicitly handle cases where the input array contains non-numeric values.  This can lead to unexpected behaviour or crashes.  The `bugSolution.php` file shows how to improve the code to handle such cases gracefully.
